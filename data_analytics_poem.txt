In the world of code and data,
We strive for truth and accutracy,
With version control, we keep track,
Of every change, no turning back.

We test and debug, we iterate,
To find the truth, we never hesitate,
with version control, we all can see,
The changes made and how they agree.

In the world of data analytics,
We seek to uncover hidden patterns,
With tools and algorithms, we analyze,
To gain insights and optimize.

We visualize and report,
Our findings to the world, we transport,
With version control, we can trust,
Our data and results, they do not rust.

Collaborating on version control,
ensures team work, and a common goal,
with branches and pull requests, 
we merge our code, with minimal stress.
