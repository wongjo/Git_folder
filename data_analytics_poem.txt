In the world of code and data,
We strive for truth and accutracy,
With version control, we keep track,
Of every change, no turning back.

We test and debug, we iterate,
To find the truth, we never hesitate,
with version control, we can see,
The changes made and how they agree.

In the world of data analytics,
We seek to uncover hidden patterns,
With tools and algorithms, we analyze,
To gain insights and optimize.
